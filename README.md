# Shapely Geometry Operations MVP
A minimal Python project demonstrating 2D polygon operations (union &amp; intersection) using Shapely.
This project is a minimal working example (MVP) showcasing 2D geometry operations using Python's Shapely library. It demonstrates:

# Features
 ðŸ“ŒPolygon union: Combining multiple polygons into one.
 
 ðŸ“ŒPolygon intersection: Finding the overlapping area between polygons.
 
 ðŸ“ŒVisualization: Using Matplotlib to display results.

# Installation
Make sure you have Python **3.x** installed. Then, install the dependencies:  
```sh
pip install shapely matplotlib
```
# Usage
Run the script:
```sh
python geometry_operations.py
```
